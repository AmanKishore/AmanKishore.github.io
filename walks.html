        <h2>Long Walks</h2>
        <p class="last-updated"><em>Last updated: January 15, 2025</em></p>
        
        <p>Honestly, I'm surprised it took me so long to write about walks.</p>

        <p>Long walks are idea-generating machines. My biggest decisions happen as a direct result of walking with close friends. 
        In SF, we'll walk miles along the Embarcadero and through North Beach, constantly iterating on whatever idea we're discussing.</p>

        <p>Ironically, every late-night walk with friends sparks a realization or decision that changes the trajectory of at least one of our lives.</p>

        <p>Yet I don't walk enough.</p>

        <p>I've yet to hit diminishing marginal returns from going on walks with friends. My goal in 2025 is to find out if there's any real limit 
        to the value I get from walking.</p>

        <p>So I'm going on more walks.</p>

        <p>If you feel like you're ready to make some life-altering decisions, let's go on a walk.</p>

        <p>Who knows? We'll probably be different people than the ones who started.</p>
