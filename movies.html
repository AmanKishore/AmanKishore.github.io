        <p>Life's short, you should make more movies.</p>

        <p>Movies == Memories worth remembering</p>

        <p>Looking back at 2024, how much of it was a blur? Can you tell me your favorite memory every month?</p>

        <p>This is what I'm trying to make more movies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Seek new experiences.</li>
            <li>Take risks.</li>
            <li>Yes > No</li>
            <li>Meet new/interesting people.</li>
            <li>Go on impromptu adventures.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I'm trying to slow down time by making more memories.</p>

        <p>Life's a blur and movies make every week feel longer.</p>

        <p>Movies are the memories you'll replay for the rest of your life. Don't you want a collection?</p>
