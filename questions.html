        <h2>Good Questions</h2>

        <p>My new metric for a great conversation is how often the other person says, "Good question."</p>

        <p>It's pretty straightforward: aim for questions that reveal a deeper story or—best-case scenario—questions they've never answered before.</p>

        <p>That's tough to master, but there's a useful hack: ask something you have no clue how they'll respond to, or something that makes them a little uncomfortable. If it's too easy to answer, it won't spark depth.</p>

        <p>Example Good Questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>What is something your best friend would say you're the best (and worst) at?</em></li>
            <li><em>If I become the most important person in your life in 10 years, what did I do?</em></li>
            <li><em>How would your best friend describe your life in 5 years? (Don't be humble.)</em></li>
            <li><em>What's something you do only because society expects you to?</em></li>
        </ul>
