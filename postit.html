        <p>For a while I’ve been writing short form because it forces me to not overthink my posts.</p>
        
        <p>Short form almost forces me to cut out filler words and get to the point. There’s also the benefit of minimal AI slop. Every recent long form post I’ve read has been written and rewritten by Claude.</p>
        
        <p>Here are my goals with these post-it notes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Write more frequently</li>
            <li>Share my thoughts publicly</li>
            <li>Get to the edge of my thinking</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>I’m curious to see what I’ll be writing about in a month.</p>
