        <h2>Fire Your Apps</h2>
        <p class="last-updated"><em>Last updated: July 31, 2025</em></p>
        
        <p>The average person checks their phone 144 times per day. What if we built apps they only needed once?</p>
        
        <p>The last wave of consumer apps was designed to be addictive. Keep users scrolling & maximize ad revenue. The business model demanded our attention.</p>
        
        <p>This time feels different.</p>
        
        <p>Users want value, not entertainment. They're willing to pay real money for apps that actually solve problems instead of creating new ones.</p>
        
        <p>The shift is obvious:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://joinsitch.com">Sitch</a> finds your person without endless swiping</li>
            <li><a href="https://lovable.dev/">Lovable</a> builds your app idea without years of coding</li>
            <li><a href="https://suno.com/">Suno</a> creates your perfect song without hitting shuffle</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Too many founders are building social media 2.0 with AI. That's the wrong direction. AI should help us spend <em>less</em> time on our phones, not more.</p>
        
        <p>The future looks like apps you "hire" once to plan your perfect dinner date or make you money while you sleep.</p>
        
        <p>Build tools, not traps.</p>
