        <h2>Big if True: Infra for AGI</h2>
        <p class="last-updated"><em>Last updated: July 21, 2024</em></p>
        
        <p>There's no chance AGI can deploy a Kubernetes compute cluster on Azure.</p>

        <p>We've seen a lot of the benefits for using LLMs for frontend and backend tasks. However, we're not seeing the same jump in utility for infra workflows.</p>

        <p>Terraform files and YAML configs are incredibly complex and we definitely need a more LLM friendly format (like python) to enable AGI to host their apps.</p>

        <p>This is why I'm so bullish on Modal. Their python abstractions of incredibly complex infra workflows enables complete infra noobs to deploy scalable applications without thinking of Kubernetes or interacting with a cloud service.</p>

        <p>Once AGI can deploy its own infra, what's left?</p>
