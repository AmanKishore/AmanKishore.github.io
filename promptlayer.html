        <p>How does your day look when 50% of your time is spent interacting with AI?</p>

        <p>AI is clearly disrupting our work and relationships. From AI coworkers (Devin) to AI friends (character.ai), the "people" we interact with daily is rapidly changing.</p>

        <p>It's not obvious to me that we will interact with AGI as we do with humans. What communication will look like is an open question few companies are solving today.</p>

        <p>This current paradigm of "prompt engineering" is the very beginnings of how we will be interacting with our fellow AI friends and co-workers.</p>

        <p>Hopefully my friends at Promptlayer can figure it out.</p>
