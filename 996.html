        <h2>996</h2>
        <p class="last-updated"><em>Last updated: January 15, 2026</em></p>

        <p>A few friends and I were discussing how Claude Code changes things. It's obvious to anyone building software today: the bottleneck is no longer building.</p>

        <p>Does this mean startups lose? I don't think so. There are still infinite problems to solve. But it fundamentally changes how founders should operate in the early stages.</p>

        <p>When every feature can be built in a day, creativity and customer listening become the priority. This was always supposed to be true. Now it's unavoidable.</p>

        <p>During my first company, the product was so technically complex that every extra minute of work mattered. That's not the case anymore.</p>

        <p>The real bottleneck is giving yourself time to think.</p>

        <p>996 hurts most founders because they never give themselves space to be creative. Creativity cannot happen heads-down. It needs randomness. Go live life.</p>

        <p>Founders would be better served spending half their time on creativity. Talk to customers. Go on long walks. Or even just stare at the wall.</p>
