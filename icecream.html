        <p>Probably the reason I'll never cut out sugar and it has nothing to do with the taste.</p>

        <p>It's a warm 80 degree summer Thursday night. The night air is slightly humid with a cool summer breeze. You've just finished a 10 hr day of work and are sitting on your couch debating reading that book that should've been finished last month.</p>

        <p>Your group chat lights up. "ice cream?".</p>

        <p>You're tired, in the middle of a cut, and have to wake up early for a customer call. But how many ice cream walks do you have left? You go, grab that extra scoop, walk aimlessly for hours with conversations that make you forget and remember. Stay up too late with no regrets finally understanding the meaning of humanity.</p>

        <p>And it all started with the simple text of "ice cream?"</p>
