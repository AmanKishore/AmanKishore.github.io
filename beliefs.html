        <p>Dispassionately try to invalidate your strongest assumptions.</p>

        <p>There's a difference between merely being willing to be wrong and actively trying to prove yourself wrong.</p>

        <p>If there's something you strongly believe, it's worth figuring out where you might be mistaken.</p>

        <p>Often, you'll find that your initial intuition was accurate, but those moments when you're wrong can completely transform your perspective.</p>

        <p>Next time you're about to discuss a strongly held belief, pretend you're completely wrong and first argue the other side to invalidate your belief.</p>

        <p>If you fail to invalidate that idea/belief then you know you're on to something.</p>

        <p>This is how the best are <strong><em>contrarian</em></strong> and <strong><em>right</em></strong>.</p>
