        <p>What, you thought it'd be easy? That's your superpower.</p>

        <p>When you're uninformed, that's when you're most dangerous. If you don't know the limitations, it means there are none.</p>

        <p>First-time founders fit this mold well. They start companies with no idea how difficult the journey will truly be.</p>

        <p>Often, second-time founders try to recreate that blissful ignorance by working on something they have zero professional experience in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sam Altman - OpenAI</li>
            <li>Elon Musk - SpaceX</li>
            <li>Blake Scholl - Boom Supersonic</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The advantages of ignorance extends beyond companies too, but that's a story for another time. For now, just remember that usually ignorance is bliss.</p>
