        <h2>You're Wasting Your Time on UI</h2>

        <p>Nobody wants another tool they have to learn.</p>

        <p>For the past two decades, building B2B software meant the same thing. Build something valuable, then spend months iterating on the UI to make it intuitive. Your product could be incredible, but if it was hard to use, nobody would extract value from it. Product sense mattered. Delightful experiences mattered.</p>

        <p>That era has ended.</p>

        <p>What customers expect from you now is fundamentally different. They don't want tools. They want the work done.</p>

        <p>Lawyers don't want a contract review tool. They want the contract redlined. Financial analysts don't want a DCF builder. They want the DCF model done.</p>

        <p>The line between software and services is blurring. You're not selling tools anymore. You're selling the work. <a href="replace.html">Replace, not augment</a>.</p>

        <p>This is exciting, but it raises the hardest question for founders building new B2B products.</p>

        <p>What can you deliver that won't be one-shot by the labs?</p>
