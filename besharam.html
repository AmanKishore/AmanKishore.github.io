        <h2>Besharam</h2>
        <p class="last-updated"><em>Last updated: February 12, 2026</em></p>

        <p>Besharam is a Hindi word for shameless. My mom used to call me besharam as an insult whenever I did something that annoyed her. As I've grown older, I think of it as a compliment.</p>

        <p>Doing things without fear of how other people see you is a superpower.</p>

        <p>Everybody knows that getting what you want requires going through embarrassing moments. Asking that girl out, reaching out to the right person, making a bold career move, building a brand. It always starts as embarrassing before it's successful.</p>

        <p>But I have an even better reason to be shameless: it lets you live longer.</p>

        <p>Think about it. All the memories you have making a fool of yourself are ingrained in your mind. Your past is just a collection of stories. We should all be story-maxing.</p>

        <p>The best way to do that? Be besharam. Go do things that are embarrassing with a high chance of failure. Once in a while, it becomes an incredible story. More often, you'll just create a fun memory.</p>

        <p>Be besharam, you won't regret it.</p>
