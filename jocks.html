        <h2>Software Companies For the Jocks</h2>
        <p class="last-updated"><em>Last updated: July 13, 2025</em></p>
        
        <p>Software is no longer just for the nerds.</p>
        
        <p>Here are the new playbooks for the jocks:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>The McKinseys</strong>
                <p>
                    Custom software is easier than ever to build, but enterprises will always outsource. The McKinseys will staff forward-deployed engineers to build whatever the enterprise needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perfect for the founder who wants to spend their time inside the enterprise, earning trust, with a high bar for customer service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="cursor.html">Cursor is the new Powerpoint</a>. Deliver high quality, custom products and scale and delight your customers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The CPGs</strong>
                <p>
                    This playbook is straight from the CPG companies of the 2010s: build a thin product with a slight variation and better branding. Throw money into distribution to grab attention and users. Sell the company before anyone asks about retention or product quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Huge for the “idea guys” who want to max out their distribution game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the Icon and Cluely strategy. See <a href="https://ethanding.substack.com/p/levered-beta-is-all-you-need" target="_blank">Levered Beta</a>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The AI Firms</strong>
                <p>
                    Finally, the slow &amp; expensive incumbents (I.e. PWC) have real competition. Services are massive and “AI Firms” will capture a ton of the value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MBAs who’ve always dreamed of starting a services firm can now chase crazy margins - if they actually enjoy the ops part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The AI law firm delivers much higher quality, which will earn the trust to beat the incumbents.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>
            Traditional business types chase “The McKinsey” or  “The AI Firm” playbooks. College kids chasing quick money will run “The CPG” strategy.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So, what should the nerds build next?
