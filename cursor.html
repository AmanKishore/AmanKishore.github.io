        <h2>Cursor is the new Powerpoint</h2>
        <p class="last-updated"><em>Last updated: July 10, 2025</em></p>
        
        <p>Software is trivial to build.</p>
        
        <p>
            Every company wants to automate their busywork. The innovative ones will use Cursor to replace almost all their manual work internally. But the vast majority of older enterprises? They'll need specialized help.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This is the McKinsey-fication of software. Armed with nothing but Cursor, we'll see consultants (affectionately known as forward-deployed engineers) parachute into these companies.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This time, it’s not MBAs with slides. It’s engineers with AI copilots.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            With Cursor, code is the new consulting.
