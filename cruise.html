        <h2>It's time to restart Cruise</h2>
        <p class="last-updated"><em>Last updated: July 17, 2025</em></p>

        <p>Imagine. The year is 2026. Transformers have solved vision. No need to waste years iteratively improving models and collecting data.</p>

        <p>
            While Tesla & Waymo chase robo-taxis, you build the <b><i>first-class</i></b> autonomous travel experience. Picture a vehicle with reclining pods, blackout windows and entertainment. You board in LA at midnight and wake up in SF at 7am. This route alone is lucrative: Americans spend $1.25B/year on travel between LA & SF.
        </p>

        <p>Let's compare the attempts to bridge LA & SF so far:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hyperloop projects raised over $1B (all failed), with even the lowest total cost estimates running $6B+</li>
            <li>California High Speed Rail has been in progress for 16 years, $15B spent, with a projected total cost of $135B</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Build the luxury autonomous vehicle that finally connects LA & SF. Start with a long-range prototype that covers distance in a single charge. Then design the high-end vehicle experience. Target the commuters that travel at night (less traffic, easier autonomy). Every AV company is designing the exact same experience.
        </p>

        <p>It's time to be creative.</p>
